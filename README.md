# meals_app

Simple cross-platform app made with flutter.

It is about loading a list of recipes with their steps, preparation duration, types and more ...

In it you can filter certain types of recipes and mark one or the other as a favorite and in the same way see all these favorite recipes on a separate screen.

The application has a small state problem when trying to remove a recipe as a favorite from the favorite recipes screen but it will be solved by implementing a better state management. Besides that, it only has a few opportunities in user experience and the code was also optimized so as not to present any bad practices of the dart language.

Only the native design of material design is shown in both android and ios, in a future version the native design of ios will be implemented as well.
